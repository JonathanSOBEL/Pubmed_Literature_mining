# Pubmed_Literature_mining
the goal of this project is to query Pubmed in an automated way to produce a summarized knowledge of any field.
This script allows to analyse meshwords, authors influence in the field, journals influence and so on.
I would like to add some other features like: some controled vocabulary to parse pubmed abstract to retrieve biological pathway or GO terms and lists of proteins in different model organisms. One other important feature could be the ability to analyse a list of pdf files in a given archive.

You might have other ideas and I would be happy to improve this code with you.
